# Popcorn Time

React codealong.



## Handle form submission

- In the parent component (<Main>), add the method createMovie()
- When we render the child component (<AddMovie>), pass a reference to that method through props
- When the user submits the form, invoke that method of the parent component (and pass the information about the new movie)
- In createMovie(), update state (adding the new movie to this.state.moviesToDisplay)
